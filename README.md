**Easily call your parrot with a goat horn whenever you need it**

_The parrot can be anywhere, it always works to teleport it to you, even in unloaded chunks_

There's currently a bug, where if the parrot you want to call is too far away it will be invisible after the teleport 

--> to fix that you have to **rejoin the game**

## How it works

**1.** Tame a parrot

**2.** Give the parrot any name

**3.** Hold any goat horn you want in your hand

**4.** Sneak and look at the parrot for 4 seconds

**4.** You will then get a horn that looks enchanted and has the name of the parrot

**5.** Whenever you use the horn, it will teleport to you

--> Only the owner of the parrot can get the goat horn + use the goat horn to call the parrot
